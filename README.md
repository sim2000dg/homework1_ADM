Repository for the first homework of Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining @Sapienza


In this repository there are two files and one directory. The two main files are:
- __challenges.pdf__ holding the screenshots (as a single pdf) of the Hackerrank submission webpage. This is for both the first and the second problem. 
- __scripts_p1.py__ holding the solutions to the challenges for the first problem. Pieces of code are preceded by a line of comment with the title of the specific challenge they solve. 


__problem2_scripts__ is a directory holding the single Python files with the solutions to the challenges of the second problem. These solutions are in general a bit more commented than the scripts of problem 1.
