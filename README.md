Repository for the first homework of the Algorithm Methods for Data Mining course @Sapienza


In this repository there are three files and one directory. The three main files are:
- __challenges.pdf__ holding the screenshots (as a single pdf) of the Hackerrank submission webpage. This is for both the first and the second problem. 
- __scripts_p1.py__ holding the solutions to the challenges for the first problem. Pieces of code are preceded by a line of comment with the title of the specific challenge they solve. 
- __algoscripts1stproj__ holding the single Python files with the solutions to the challenges of the second problem. These solutions are in general a bit more commented than the scripts of problem 1.
